            <p class='indented'>Currently our world runs on data, which comes from a myriad of different sources such as transaction systems, stock market data, news channels, mobile application, and IOT. Everywhere copious amounts of data are sifted through to derive meaningful strategies that predict stock market trends, customer behavior, and social behavior. The outcome of mining the data using different science can anticipate and predict customer behavior, market trends to name a few patterns.

            <p class='indented'>My project involves analyzing the stock prices of outliers and graphing the data without the influence of outliers. Outliers are data points which differ significantly to the rest of the data points. Time series models stocks predict future prices which helps the stock buyer decide when to buy or sell stocks. Time series looks at sequences of historical data to predict the seasonality of the stock price.. To accomplish this, I have built this website and the following tasks were performed.</p>
          
            <p class='indented'><b>Step 1:</b> Angular CLI, Node.js, Git CLI and visual studio were downloaded and the environment was set up to build the website.
              <br>
              <b>Step 2:</b> The next important step was to identify the market data to analyze stock performance. Based on my research, I was able to identify a free API from marketstack.com. Market stack API provided historical data stock prices from various exchanges around the world.
              <br>
              <b>Step 3:</b> Used Angular to build the front end webpage which calls the Marketstack using rest API
              <br>
              <b>Step 4:</b> The market data from the API was fed to Time series model
              <br>
              <b>Step 5:</b> Time series model analysis is done using the following Python packages and R in Jupyter notebook. The output
              of the timeseries model was displayed on the website
            </p>
            <ul class='indented'>
              <li><b>Plotly</b>- Used for interactive web-based visualizations that can be displayed in Jupyter notebooks</li>
              <li><b>Numpy</b> - Used to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays. It adds powerful data structures to
                Python that guarantee efficient calculations with arrays and matrices and it supplies an enormous library of
                high-level mathematical functions that operate on these arrays and matrices.</li>
              <li><b>Pandas</b> - Used to convert Numpy array to a Pandas data frame.</li>
              <li> <b>Datetime</b> - Used to work with date and time. These classes provide a number of functions to deal with dates,
                times
                and time intervals. Date and datetime are an object in Python, so when you manipulate them, you are actually
                manipulating objects and not string or timestamps.</li>
            </ul> 
          
          
          
            <p class='indented'><b>Step 6:</b> Level-shift Outlier analysis was done using R packages.  A Level Shift (LS) represents an abrupt change in the mean level and it may be seasonal (Seasonal Level Shift, SLS) or not.  Some of the exogenous events like the Hurricanes, pandemic have caused massive level-shifts in most travel verticals. Packages used:.</p>
            <ul class='indented'>
              <li><b>tsoutliers. -</b> This package implements a procedure  for automatic detection of outliers in time series.</li>
              <li><b>bcp –</b>this package allows estimation of change point models with multivariate responses</li>

              Use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Model to Predict Stock Prices and compare with various other predicting techniques
